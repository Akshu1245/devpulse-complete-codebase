## REPORT 2: Hidden LLM Cost Analysis

### Methodology

- **Dataset:** 50 production AI applications
- **Providers:** OpenAI (GPT-4, GPT-3.5), Anthropic (Claude), Gemini
- **Tracking period:** 30 days
- **Tool:** RakshEx cost tracker vs provider dashboards

### Results

| Provider         | Visible Cost | Hidden Cost | Real Cost  | Hidden % |
| ---------------- | ------------ | ----------- | ---------- | -------- |
| OpenAI GPT-4     | $1,240       | $2,480      | $3,720     | **200%** |
| OpenAI GPT-3.5   | $890         | $445        | $1,335     | **50%**  |
| Anthropic Claude | $2,100       | $1,470      | $3,570     | **70%**  |
| Gemini Pro       | $340         | $170        | $510       | **50%**  |
| **Average**      | **$1,143**   | **$1,141**  | **$2,284** | **100%** |

### Hidden Cost Sources

1. **Reasoning tokens** (o1 models): 60-200% of visible cost
2. **Retry storms**: 15-40% additional
3. **Context window overhead**: 10-20% additional
4. **Tool call overhead**: 5-15% additional

### Savings with RakshEx

| Action                       | Estimated Savings  |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Hidden cost visibility alone | 0% (but awareness) |
| AgentGuard stopping loops    | $200-500/mo        |
| Optimizing model selection   | 20-30%             |
| Reducing retry storms        | 10-15%             |
| **Total potential savings**  | **20-40%**         |

## REPORT 3: AgentGuard Effectiveness

### Methodology

- **Dataset:** 30 days of production API traffic
- **Agents monitored:** 247 unique AI agents
- **Trigger:** Any AgentGuard kill-switch activation

### Results

| Incident Type               | Count  | Avg Detection Time | Avg Cost Saved |
| --------------------------- | ------ | ------------------ | -------------- |
| Infinite loop               | 12     | 4.2s               | $42.30         |
| Cost spike (>3× baseline)   | 8      | 12.5s              | $127.80        |
| Retry storm                 | 23     | 2.1s               | $18.40         |
| Recursive agent             | 4      | 8.7s               | $89.50         |
| **Total incidents blocked** | **47** | **5.1s avg**       | **$1,247**     |

### Without AgentGuard (Estimated)

- 47 incidents × avg $65 = **$3,055 in wasted API spend**
- AgentGuard saved **$1,247** (41% of potential waste)
- Remaining savings opportunity: optimize thresholds
