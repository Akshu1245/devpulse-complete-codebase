## TRUST SCORE FORMULA

```
Trust Score = (True Positives × 2) - (False Positives × 3) - (Ignored Findings × 1)
              ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
              Total Findings

Target: Trust Score ≥ 1.5
Current: ___

## CONTINUOUS VALIDATION PIPELINE

## FALSE POSITIVE REDUCTION

### FP Tracking

| Rule                              | Total Fired | FPs Reported | FP Rate | Action |
| --------------------------------- | ----------- | ------------ | ------- | ------ |
| Missing auth on public endpoint   |             |              |         |        |
| HTTP instead of HTTPS (localhost) |             |              |         |        |
| Exposed key in test fixture       |             |              |         |        |
| Prompt injection in documentation |             |              |         |        |

### FP Feedback Loop

```
User marks finding as FP
  → Record: finding type, rule, confidence, context
  → Adjust: lower confidence for similar patterns
  → Review: weekly FP analysis meeting
  → Fix: update rule or add exception
  → Validate: re-scan same collection
```

## REMEDIATION CLARITY SCORE

For each finding, measure:

| Criterion          | Weight | Score |
| ------------------ | ------ | ----- |
| Clear title        | 20%    | 1-5   |
| Specific location  | 20%    | 1-5   |
| Evidence provided  | 20%    | 1-5   |
| Fix steps included | 20%    | 1-5   |
| Code example given | 20%    | 1-5   |

**Target avg: 4.0+**
**Current: \_\_\_**

### Remediation Improvement Backlog

| Finding Type     | Current Score | Issue | Fix | Owner |
| ---------------- | ------------- | ----- | --- | ----- |
| Exposed secret   |               |       |     |       |
| Missing auth     |               |       |     |       |
| HTTP endpoint    |               |       |     |       |
| Prompt injection |               |       |     |       |
| Cost anomaly     |               |       |     |       |

## CONFIDENCE SCORING VALIDATION

### Confidence Calibration

| Confidence Range | Actual Accuracy | Calibration |
| ---------------- | --------------- | ----------- |
| 95-100%          | \_\_\_%         | \_\_\_      |
| 80-94%           | \_\_\_%         | \_\_\_      |
| 60-79%           | \_\_\_%         | \_\_\_      |
| 40-59%           | \_\_\_%         | \_\_\_      |
| < 40%            | \_\_\_%         | \_\_\_      |

**Well-calibrated when:** 95% confidence → ~95% accuracy
