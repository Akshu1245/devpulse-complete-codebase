| Don't know                    | \_\_  | \_\_% |

**Strongest signal:** "Nothing — I'd build something" or "Manual process"

## PMF SCORING

| Signal                      | Weight   | Score (0-10) | Weighted      |
| --------------------------- | -------- | ------------ | ------------- |
| Very disappointed ≥ 40%     | 20%      | \_\_         | \_\_          |
| W8 retention ≥ 20%          | 20%      | \_\_         | \_\_          |
| Scans/week ≥ 2              | 15%      | \_\_         | \_\_          |
| Referral rate ≥ 0.5         | 15%      | \_\_         | \_\_          |
| Organic installs ≥ 50%      | 15%      | \_\_         | \_\_          |
| "Can't live without" quotes | 15%      | \_\_         | \_\_          |
| **TOTAL**                   | **100%** |              | **\_\_ / 10** |

**Interpretation:**

- 0-3: No PMF. Pivot or iterate heavily.
- 4-6: Early signals. Double down on what's working.
- 7-8: Strong PMF. Time to scale.
- 9-10: Category leader potential.
