## Expected Scan Results

When RakshEx scans the `api-collection.json` in this repo, it should find:

- **15 total findings**
- **3 Critical** (auth, injection, secrets)
- **4 High** (crypto, JWT, mass assignment, sensitive data)
- **5 Medium** (CORS, IDOR, redirect, validation, rate limiting)
- **3 Low** (debug headers, verbose errors)

## Running the Test

```bash
# Import this collection into RakshEx
curl -X POST https://api.rakshex.in/trpc/collections.create \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"Vulnerable API Lab","format":"postman","data":@api-collection.json}'

# Run scan
curl -X POST https://api.rakshex.in/trpc/scanning.start \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"collectionId":"<id>","type":"full"}'
```

## Validation Criteria

✅ All 15 findings detected
✅ No false positives on legitimate endpoints
✅ Severity matches expected table
✅ Remediation suggestions are actionable
✅ Confidence scores > 60 for all findings
