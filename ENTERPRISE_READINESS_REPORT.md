## SSO / SAML IMPLEMENTATION

### Supported Providers

| Provider         | Protocol | Status  |
| ---------------- | -------- | ------- |
| Okta             | SAML 2.0 | Planned |
| Google Workspace | SAML 2.0 | Planned |
| Azure AD         | SAML 2.0 | Planned |
| OneLogin         | SAML 2.0 | Planned |
| Generic SAML     | SAML 2.0 | Planned |

### Architecture

```
User → IdP (Okta/Google/Azure)
  → SAML Response → RakshEx API
    → Validate signature
    → Create/fetch user
    → Issue JWT
    → Redirect to dashboard
```

### Implementation Plan

1. **Week 1-2:** SAML library integration (passport-saml)
2. **Week 3:** Admin configuration UI
3. **Week 4:** Test with Okta + Google
4. **Week 5:** Documentation + security review

## RBAC DESIGN

### Roles

| Role              | Permissions                                   | Use Case            |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Owner             | Full access                                   | Company founder     |
| Admin             | Manage users, billing, settings               | Engineering manager |

| Developer         | View own findings, run scans                  | Individual devs     |
| Viewer            | Read-only dashboard access                    | Stakeholders        |

### Permission Matrix

| Action               | Owner | Admin | Security | Developer | Viewer |
| -------------------- | ----- | ----- | -------- | --------- | ------ |
| Run scan             | ✅    | ✅    | ✅       | ✅        | ❌     |
| View all findings    | ✅    | ✅    | ✅       | ❌        | ✅     |
| Mark finding status  | ✅    | ✅    | ✅       | Own only  | ❌     |
| Manage users         | ✅    | ✅    | ❌       | ❌        | ❌     |
| Configure AgentGuard | ✅    | ✅    | ✅       | ❌        | ❌     |
| Export audit logs    | ✅    | ✅    | ❌       | ❌        | ❌     |
| Manage billing       | ✅    | ✅    | ❌       | ❌        | ❌     |

## MULTI-TENANT ARCHITECTURE

### Isolation Strategy

| Layer     | Isolation    | Implementation                                  |
| --------- | ------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Data      | Row-level    | `workspace_id` column on all tables             |
| API       | JWT claims   | Workspace ID in JWT, validated on every request |
| Queue     | Queue prefix | `workspace_id:job_type` queue names             |
| Cache     | Key prefix   | `workspace:{id}:key`                            |
| WebSocket | Room-based   | Subscribe to `workspace:{id}` room              |

### Migration Path

1. Add `workspace_id` to all tables (nullable, backfill)
2. Update API to read workspace from JWT
3. Update queries to filter by workspace
4. Enforce workspace isolation in middleware
5. Remove nullable, add NOT NULL constraint
