## OUR SECURITY PROMISE

**RakshEx is designed to protect you, not watch you.**

1. **Your code stays yours.** We never store your source code.
2. **Your data is encrypted.** AES-256-GCM at rest, TLS 1.3 in transit.
3. **You control everything.** Opt out of any feature anytime.
4. **We're transparent.** Open about what we collect and why.
5. **We're accountable.** Public status, public incidents, public fixes.
