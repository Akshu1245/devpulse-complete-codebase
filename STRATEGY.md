# RakshEx — Solo Founder Strategic Plan

# Market-Ready AI Runtime Governance Platform

---

## 1. THE CORE INSIGHT

**"Every company adopting LLMs in production will hit the same wall: governance."**

The market is splitting into three camps:

- **Observability tools** (Helicone, Portkey, LangSmith) — tell you what happened
- **Security point solutions** (Lakera, GuardRails) — protect one surface
- **RakshEx** — governs the entire AI runtime: security + cost + compliance in one platform

No competitor does all three. Enterprises are buying 4-6 tools and stitching them together. RakshEx's advantage: **one platform, one audit trail, one deployment.**

**The gap is clear: RakshEx is the only platform doing ALL of these.** Everyone else is a point solution.

---

## 3. REAL PAIN POINTS WE SOLVE

### Pain Point #1: "We have no idea how much we're spending on AI"

- Teams embed LLM calls across 20+ microservices
- No centralized visibility into cost per model, per team, per agent
- **RakshEx solution**: Inline gateway logs every call + cost forecasting + anomaly detection + kill switch

### Pain Point #2: "We're terrified of prompt injection but don't know where to start"

- CISO says "no LLMs until security is sorted"
- Engineers say "we need LLMs now to ship features"
- Deadlock = innovation freeze
- **RakshEx solution**: Drop-in gateway, 87-payload library, configurable thresholds. Deploy in hours.

### Pain Point #3: "Our SOC 2 auditor asked how we govern AI decisions"

- Most companies have zero answer — they're crossing fingers
- No audit trail, no evidence, no controls
- **RakshEx solution**: Gateway audit trail + SOC 2 evidence pack builder + PCI DSS reports

### Pain Point #4: "Employees are using ChatGPT/Claude with company data"

- Shadow AI is invisible, ungoverned, and a compliance nightmare
- IT can't block everything without blocking innovation
- **RakshEx solution**: Shadow AI detection + allowlist/denylist + egress monitoring

### Pain Point #5: "Our AI agents have tool access — what if they go rogue?"

- MCP tools can write files, send emails, access databases
- No governance over what tools agents can call
- **RakshEx solution**: Tool-approval workflow + MCP invocation audit log + risk classification

### Pain Point #6: "We're building AI features but can't manage API security at the same time"

- New AI endpoints = new attack surface
- Shadow APIs in microservices go unmonitored
- **RakshEx solution**: Postman/OpenAPI import → scan → findings → auto-fix in one workflow

## 4. IMPORT FROM COMPETITORS — THE MIGRATION STRATEGY

### Strategy: "Switch in 5 Minutes, Get 10x More"

We need importers that make switching from any competitor trivial. The pitch: "You're already paying for Helicone + Lakera + manual compliance. Switch to RakshEx, get everything in one place, and we'll migrate your data for you."

### 4.1 Import from Helicone

**What to import**: Request logs, cost data, API keys, cached prompts
**Implementation**:

- Helicone exports via their API (`GET /v1/request`) or CSV export
- Parse Helicone's log format → RakshEx `gatewayAudit` + `tokenUsage` tables
- Map Helicone's `model` → RakshEx's model registry
- Preserve timestamps, token counts, costs
- Create a `POST /api/import/helicone` endpoint + UI uploader

### 4.2 Import from Portkey

**What to import**: Provider configs, virtual keys, routing rules, request logs
**Implementation**:

- Portkey exports via API or dashboard CSV
- Map Portkey's provider configs → RakshEx `tenantPolicies`
- Map routing rules → gateway config
- Import request history → `gatewayAudit`

### 4.3 Import from Lakera

**What to import**: Blocklists, allowlists, detection thresholds
**Implementation**:

- Lakera Guard has configuration export
- Map Lakera's policy settings → RakshEx's `tenantPolicies` YAML
- Import Lakera's payload library (if accessible) → RakshEx's prompt-injection payloads
- One-click policy translation: Lakera config → RakshEx Policy DSL

### 4.4 Import from Postman / OpenAPI (Already Built)

- Already exists: Postman collection JSON → RakshEx `collections` table
- Auto-scans on import for credentials, endpoints, security issues
- **Enhancement needed**: Add SwaggerHub import, Insomnia import, Bruno import

### 4.5 Import from LangSmith

**What to import**: Traces, runs, feedback scores
**Implementation**:

- LangSmith provides trace export via SDK/API
- Map traces → RakshEx `gatewayAudit` with run IDs
- Map feedback → finding status (good feedback = resolved, bad feedback = open finding)

### 4.6 Universal CSV/JSON Import

**What**: A generic importer that accepts any CSV/JSON with column mapping
**Implementation**:

- Upload CSV/JSON → preview columns → map to RakshEx schema → validate → import
- Handles: Helicone CSV, Portkey CSV, custom logging formats, AWS Bedrock logs

## 6. PRICING STRATEGY

### Current: Razorpay (India-first) with Stripe scaffolded

| Plan           | Price   | What You Get                                                                                                                         |
| -------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Free**       | $0/mo   | 1 user, 1 collection, 100 gateway requests/mo, 10 scans/mo, community support                                                        |
| **Pro**        | $99/mo  | 5 users, 10 collections, 10k gateway requests/mo, unlimited scans, email support, SOC 2 evidence                                     |
| **Enterprise** | $499/mo | Unlimited users, unlimited collections, custom gateway limits, SSO, RBAC, audit log export, SLA, dedicated support, self-host option |

### Why This Pricing Wins:

- **Free tier captures developers** → They experience the gateway value immediately
- **Pro at $99/mo undercuts Helicone Pro ($20/user/mo for 5 users = $100) + Lakera ($1k+/mo)** = 10x cheaper for more features
- **Enterprise at $499/mo vs Protect AI at $50k+/yr** = 100x cheaper
- **Annual discount (20%) = $79/mo Pro, $399/mo Enterprise** → Lock in revenue

### Expansion Revenue:

- **Overages**: $0.01 per 1k gateway requests beyond plan limit
- **Add-on seats**: $20/user/mo beyond plan limit
- **Professional Services**: SOC 2 readiness consulting, custom policy building, red-team customization

## 8. BRAND POSITIONING

### One-Liner:

**"RakshEx: The firewall your LLMs have been missing."**

### Elevator Pitch:

"Every company is racing to adopt AI, but no one is securing it. RakshEx is the world's first AI Runtime Governance Platform — it sits between your applications and LLM providers, blocking prompt injections, redacting PII, enforcing budgets, and generating compliance evidence. Drop it in with one line of code, get a complete audit trail out of the box. Your CISO will thank you. Your SOC 2 auditor will thank you. Your CFO will thank you."

### Differentiators (vs each competitor):

- **vs Helicone**: "Helicone tells you what happened. RakshEx stops what shouldn't happen."
- **vs Lakera**: "Lakera protects against prompt injection. RakshEx protects your entire AI surface — security, cost, compliance."
- **vs Portkey**: "Portkey routes your LLM calls. RakshEx governs them."
- **vs Protect AI**: "Protect AI costs $50k and takes weeks to deploy. RakshEx costs $99 and deploys in 5 minutes."

## 12. THE LONG GAME

RakshEx's end-state: **The default governance layer for every AI application.**

Every company building with LLMs will eventually need:

- A gateway to route and monitor traffic
- A policy engine to enforce security rules
- A compliance system to generate audit evidence
- A cost management system to control spending

RakshEx provides all four in one platform. The market is moving fast, but the governance gap is growing faster. The companies that solve governance first will define the category.

**The category is ours to define. Let's ship it.**
