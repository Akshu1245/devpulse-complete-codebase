# RakshEx YC Interview Practice Script

> Scripts for 1-minute, 3-minute, and 10-minute pitches.

## 1-MINUTE ELEVATOR PITCH

**Goal:** Get them to say "tell me more"

```
"Every developer building with AI is paying 2-3× more for LLM APIs
than they realize.

Hidden reasoning tokens. Infinite loops. Leaked API keys.

RakshEx is a VS Code extension that detects all three.

We reveal hidden costs, auto-stop rogue agents, and scan API
collections for vulnerabilities — without leaving the editor.

Free during beta. 500 developers already using it.

We've saved users $14,000 and stopped 47 rogue agents in 30 days."
```

**Practice tip:** Record yourself. Target: 58-62 seconds. No notes.

## 3-MINUTE STANDARD PITCH

**Goal:** Cover problem, solution, traction, team, ask

```
[0:00-0:15] HOOK
"Last year at Flipkart, our AI team got a $50,000 surprise
OpenAI bill. The dashboard showed $18,000. The rest was hidden
reasoning tokens.

I built an internal tool to fix this. Then I realized:
every AI developer has this problem."

[0:15-0:45] PROBLEM
"Three things are killing AI developers:

One: Hidden reasoning tokens cost 3× more than providers show.
Your $0.02 API call is actually $0.06.

Two: Rogue agents loop infinitely. One developer's 'simple
summarizer' called GPT-4 recursively for 6 hours. Cost: $247.

Three: API keys leak into shared collections. We scanned 1,000
GitHub repos and found secrets in 23% of them.

No existing tool solves all three."

[0:45-1:30] SOLUTION
"RakshEx is a VS Code extension with three features:

Hidden Cost Detection: We attribute every API call to its
real cost, including hidden reasoning tokens. We show you
per-endpoint breakdowns and alert on spikes.

AgentGuard: Auto-stops infinite loops and cost anomalies
in real-time. Configurable thresholds. No code changes needed.

Security Scanning: Import any Postman, OpenAPI, or Bruno
collection. Get a full security report in seconds.

Everything happens inside VS Code. No context switching.

[1:30-2:00] TRACTION
"In 30 days of beta:
- 500 developers using RakshEx
- $14,000 in hidden costs found
- 47 rogue agents stopped
- 234 exposed secrets found
- 87% true positive rate on security scans

We have 10 paying beta customers at $29/mo."

[2:00-2:30] MARKET
"30 million developers worldwide are building with AI.
If 5% convert to Pro at $29/mo, that's $522M ARR.

But the real opportunity is enterprise. Every company using
AI needs this. SOC2, GDPR, PCI — all require AI security.
That's a $10B+ market by 2028."

[2:30-3:00] TEAM + ASK
"I'm Akshay. 5 years at Flipkart building API infrastructure.
Found $1.2M in hidden API costs. Built security tools used
by 200+ engineers.

I quit Flipkart 6 months ago to solve this full-time.

We're raising a seed round to scale from hundreds to
millions of developers."
```

**Practice tip:** Practice until you can do this in your sleep.

## 10-MINUTE INVESTOR WALKTHROUGH

**Goal:** Deep dive with room for questions

**Structure:**

1. **2 min:** Problem + personal story
2. **3 min:** Live demo (show, don't tell)
3. **2 min:** Traction + metrics
4. **2 min:** Market + business model
5. **1 min:** Team + ask

**Demo Script (3 minutes):**

```
"Let me show you RakshEx in action.

[0:00] Here's VS Code with the RakshEx sidebar.
I've imported a Postman collection with 15 endpoints.

[0:10] I click 'Run Scan'. Watch this.

[0:15] RakshEx found 6 issues: 1 Critical, 2 High.
Let me show you the Critical one.

[0:30] 'Exposed API key in DELETE /users/456'
Confidence: 99%. Evidence: the header value 'sk_live_...'
Remediation: rotate the key, use environment variables.

[0:45] Now the cost dashboard. This shows visible vs
hidden costs per endpoint. See this one? $0.02 visible,
$0.06 real. That's hidden reasoning tokens.

[1:00] AgentGuard configuration. I set the threshold:
max 20 calls per minute. If anything exceeds this,
it stops automatically.

[1:15] Here's a real alert: 'AgentGuard stopped a rogue
agent after 847 calls. Potential savings: $42.'

[1:30] And this is the weekly summary: money saved,
agents stopped, secrets found.

[1:45] Everything happens inside VS Code. One click to fix.
No context switching. No external dashboards.

[2:00] That's RakshEx. Questions?"
```

## ANTICIPATED Q&A

### "How do you differentiate from Snyk?"

"Snyk is excellent for traditional app security. We're specifically
for AI/LLM applications:

1. We detect hidden reasoning tokens — Snyk doesn't know what those are
2. AgentGuard stops infinite loops — Snyk is static analysis only
3. We're native to VS Code — Snyk requires context switching

Many users use both. Snyk for their app code, us for their AI layer."

### "What's your moat?"

"Three things:

1. Workflow lock-in. We're inside VS Code. Developers don't
   want to switch editors for security.
2. The patent-pending thinking token attribution method.
   We filed NHCE/DEV/2026/001.
3. The data flywheel. Every scan makes our detection better.
   More users = more data = better accuracy = more users."

### "Why you?"

"I lived this problem for 5 years at Flipkart. I found $1.2M
in hidden API costs and built internal tools that 200+ engineers
used daily.

I know exactly where the money is hidden and exactly how to
find it. I'm not a security researcher who learned about LLMs
last year — I'm an infrastructure engineer who watched AI costs
explode firsthand."

### "Why now?"

"AI adoption is accelerating exponentially. OpenAI revenue
grew from $0 to $2B in 2 years. But security tooling hasn't
caught up.

Every company using AI will need AI-specific security.
The window to be the category leader is closing."

### "What's the biggest risk?"

"Competition from established security players. If Snyk or
Datadog decides to build LLM-specific features, they have
more resources than us.

Our defense: speed, developer love, and workflow lock-in.
By the time they notice us, we'll have 10,000 developers
who don't want to switch."
