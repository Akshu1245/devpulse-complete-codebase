## RULES OF EXECUTION

1. **Ship every week.** Something must go live every Friday.
2. **Metrics over opinions.** When in doubt, look at the data.
3. **Users over features.** Talk to users before writing code.
4. **Speed over perfection.** 80% done and shipped beats 100% done and hidden.
5. **No silent failures.** If something breaks, everyone knows in 5 minutes.
6. **Write it down.** Decisions, learnings, and processes are documented.
7. **Celebrate wins.** Even small ones. Momentum matters.

_Operating rhythm maintained by founder._
