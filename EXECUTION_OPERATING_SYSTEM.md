# RakshEx Execution Operating System

> How we operate as a world-class startup.
> Date: 2026-05-17

## OPERATING PRINCIPLES

1. **Users over everything.** Every decision starts with "what do users need?"
2. **Ship every week.** Something must go live every Friday.
3. **Metrics over opinions.** When in doubt, look at the data.
4. **Speed over perfection.** 80% done and shipped beats 100% hidden.
5. **Trust compounds.** Every interaction either builds or destroys trust.
6. **No silent failures.** If something breaks, everyone knows in 5 minutes.
7. **Write it down.** Decisions, learnings, and processes are documented.
8. **Celebrate wins.** Even small ones. Momentum matters.

## DECISION FRAMEWORK

### The "5 Whys" for Every Feature

Before building anything, ask:

1. What user problem does this solve?
2. How many users have this problem?
3. Is this the most important problem to solve right now?
4. What's the simplest version that solves it?
5. How will we know if it worked?

### The "Kill Criteria"

Kill a feature if:

- Usage < 10% of active users after 30 days
- Support tickets > 2/week about it
- It slows scans by > 20%
- It complicates onboarding
- No user asked for it
