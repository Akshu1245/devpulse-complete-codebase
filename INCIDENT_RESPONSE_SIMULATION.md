## SIMULATION 1: DATABASE FAILURE

### Scenario

Primary MySQL instance crashes during peak hours (Tuesday 2 PM IST).

### Timeline

**T+0 min — Detection**

- Alert: "MySQL connection errors > 5%"
- On-call receives P0 page
- SRE confirms: database unreachable

**T+2 min — Response**

- SRE checks RDS dashboard: instance status = "Failed"
- Decision: Failover to read replica
- Execute: `aws rds promote-read-replica rakshex-db-replica`

**T+5 min — Assessment**

- Replica promoted, accepting writes
- Check data consistency: ✅ Last transaction 30s ago
- Notify team in #incidents Slack

**T+8 min — Recovery**

- API servers restart connections
- Health checks passing
- Monitor error rates: dropping

**T+15 min — Verification**

- All services green
- Queue processing resumes
- User impact: 8 min of degraded service

**T+30 min — Communication**

- Post-mortem draft started
- User notification: "Brief service interruption resolved"

## SIMULATION 2: API PROVIDER OUTAGE

### Scenario

OpenAI API returns 503 errors for 30 minutes. RakshEx users can't validate keys.

### Timeline

**T+0 min — Detection**

- Alert: "OpenAI API error rate > 10%"
- Error classification: provider outage

**T+1 min — Response**

- Circuit breaker trips automatically
- Queue scan jobs with OpenAI dependency
- Show user-friendly message: "OpenAI is experiencing issues. Retrying automatically."

**T+5 min — Assessment**

- Check status.openai.com: confirmed outage
- Evaluate: Can we skip OpenAI-dependent checks?
- Decision: Run non-OpenAI checks, queue OpenAI checks for retry

**T+10 min — Mitigation**

- Resume partial service
- Back off OpenAI requests (exponential)
- Alert users via in-app notification

**T+30 min — Recovery**

- OpenAI service restored
- Circuit breaker closes
- Process queued jobs

**T+35 min — Verification**

- Full service restored
- No data loss
- User impact: 30 min of partial service

## SIMULATION 3: MALICIOUS PAYLOAD STORM

### Scenario

Attacker sends 10,000 malformed scan requests / second.

### Timeline

**T+0 min — Detection**

- Alert: "Request rate > 10,000/s from single IP"
- WAF flags: "Potential DDoS"

**T+1 min — Response**

- Rate limiter activates (100 req/min per IP)
- Block offending IP at WAF level
- Alert security team

**T+3 min — Assessment**

- Check if legitimate traffic affected: No
- Review blocked requests: all malformed
- No valid user impact

**T+5 min — Recovery**

- Normal traffic patterns resume
- WAF rule updated for pattern
- Incident logged
