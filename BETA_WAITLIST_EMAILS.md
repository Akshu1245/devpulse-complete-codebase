## SEQUENCE 1: WAITLIST → BETA INVITE

### Email 1: "You're in!" (Send immediately on invite)

```
Subject: You're in the RakshEx beta 🛡️

Hi {{first_name}},

You're one of 50 developers getting early access to RakshEx.

What is it?
RakshEx is a VS Code extension that stops AI agents from burning
your API budget. It finds hidden reasoning costs, auto-stops
infinite loops, and scans your API collections for vulnerabilities.

Here's your invite code: {{invite_code}}

Get started in 60 seconds:
1. Install from the VS Code Marketplace: [link]
2. Paste your invite code when prompted
3. Import any API collection (Postman, OpenAPI, or Bruno)
4. Run your first scan

Most people find at least 2 issues they didn't know about.

Questions? Reply to this email — I read every one.

Akshay
Founder, RakshEx
```

### Email 2: "How's it going?" (Day 2, only if no scan)

```
Subject: Need help with your first RakshEx scan?

Hi {{first_name}},

I noticed you haven't run your first scan yet. No worries —
here's the fastest way to see value:

Option 1: Use our sample collection
[Download sample-collection.json] — it has 6 intentional
vulnerabilities. Import it and run a scan. Takes 30 seconds.

Option 2: Import your own
Drag any Postman, OpenAPI, or Bruno collection into the
RakshEx sidebar. We'll do the rest.

Stuck? Reply and I'll personally walk you through it.

Akshay
```

### Email 3: "What did you find?" (Day 7, if scan completed)

```
Subject: What did RakshEx find in your API collections?

Hi {{first_name}},

You've been using RakshEx for a week. I'm curious:

1. What's the most surprising thing you found?
2. Did any finding save you money or prevent a security issue?
3. What's the biggest friction you're facing?

Reply directly — I read every response and use them to
prioritize what we build next.

If you found value, would you mind leaving a review on the
VS Code Marketplace? It takes 30 seconds and helps other
developers discover RakshEx.

[Leave a review]

Thanks,
Akshay
```

### Email 4: "Weekly Protection Summary" (Every Monday)

```

### Email 5: "We're launching soon" (Day 30, pre-launch)

```
Subject: RakshEx is launching on Product Hunt next week

2. Leave a review on the VS Code Marketplace

## SEQUENCE 2: CHURN RECOVERY

### Email: "We noticed you uninstalled"

```
Subject: What happened?

Hi {{first_name}},

I noticed you uninstalled RakshEx from VS Code. I'm sorry
we didn't meet your expectations.

Mind telling me why? (30 seconds, anonymous)
[Survey link]

Common reasons:
- Couldn't find value
- Too confusing
- Found bugs
- Missing features
- Other

If we fix your issue, would you give us another try?
