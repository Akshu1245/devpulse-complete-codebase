## Security Architecture

### Authentication

- JWT with HS256, 7-day expiry
- Session versioning (invalidates on password change)
- Password hashing: bcrypt with cost factor 12
- CSRF: Double-submit cookie pattern

### Authorization

- RBAC with 4 roles: owner, admin, editor, viewer
- 9 resources × 3 actions = 27 permission combinations
- Workspace-scoped access control

### Data Protection

- AES-256-GCM encryption for vault secrets
- Per-tenant AAD (Additional Authenticated Data)
- TLS 1.3 for all transport
- HSTS with preload

### API Security

- Rate limiting: 20/15min auth, 100/hour scans, 500/min SDK
- Input validation: Zod schemas on all endpoints
- Output encoding: JSON only, no HTML injection path
- CORS: Strict allowlist, no wildcard reflection

### Infrastructure

- Security headers: CSP, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, Referrer-Policy
- Body parser limits: 5MB default, 1MB collections
- File upload: Type restricted (.json, .yaml, .yml), 50MB max
- Webhook SSRF protection: Blocklist + CIDR filter
