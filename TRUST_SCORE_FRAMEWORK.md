## SCORING

### Accuracy Score (0-100)

```
True Positive Rate:     ___% (weight: 60%)
False Positive Rate:    ___% (weight: 30%)
Remediation Success:    ___% (weight: 10%)

Accuracy Score = (TPR × 0.6) + ((100 - FPR) × 0.3) + (RS × 0.1)
```

### Transparency Score (0-100)

```
Users who read privacy policy:     ___% (weight: 20%)
Users who understand data usage:   ___% (weight: 40%)
Users who feel informed:           ___% (weight: 40%)

Transparency Score = (PP × 0.2) + (DU × 0.4) + (FI × 0.4)
```

### Reliability Score (0-100)

```
Uptime (30d):           ___% (weight: 50%)
Scan success rate:      ___% (weight: 30%)
Error rate:             ___% (weight: 20%)

Reliability Score = (Uptime × 0.5) + (SSR × 0.3) + ((100 - ER) × 0.2)
```

### Security Score (0-100)

```
Data encrypted:        ✅/❌ (weight: 30%)

```
Avg support response:    ___h (weight: 40%)
Bug fix time:            ___d (weight: 30%)
Feature request ack:     ___d (weight: 30%)

Responsiveness Score = based on SLA targets
```

## OVERALL TRUST SCORE

```
Trust Score = (Accuracy × 0.3) + (Transparency × 0.25) +
              (Reliability × 0.2) + (Security × 0.15) +
              (Responsiveness × 0.1)
