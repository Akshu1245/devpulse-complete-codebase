## ONBOARDING FRICTION ELIMINATION

| Step                           | Current Time | Target Time | Status |
| ------------------------------ | ------------ | ----------- | ------ |
| Install from marketplace       | \_\_\_       | < 2 min     |        |
| First open → Sign in visible   | \_\_\_       | < 5s        |        |
| Sign in → Connected            | \_\_\_       | < 30s       |        |
| Connected → First scan started | \_\_\_       | < 60s       |        |
| Scan → First finding visible   | \_\_\_       | < 3s        |        |
| **Total time-to-value**        | **\_\_\_**   | **< 90s**   |        |

### Onboarding Fixes

- [ ] Welcome view auto-opens on first install
- [ ] "Create Free Account" is primary CTA (not "Sign In")
- [ ] API key input has inline validation (green checkmark)
- [ ] After connect: auto-show demo or auto-scan sample
- [ ] First finding: animated highlight + celebration
- [ ] Empty state: "No issues found! 🎉" not just "No findings"

## POLISH PRINCIPLES

1. **Every pixel matters.** If it looks off, fix it.
2. **Every millisecond counts.** If it feels slow, optimize.
3. **Every word should earn its place.** If it's unclear, rewrite.
4. **Every error is an opportunity.** If something breaks, delight.
5. **Every state needs design.** Empty, loading, error, success — all designed.
