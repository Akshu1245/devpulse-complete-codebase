## 3. FEEDBACK COLLECTION SYSTEM

### In-Product Feedback

```typescript
// rakshex-vscode/src/feedback.ts
export async function showFeedbackPrompt(context: vscode.ExtensionContext) {
  // Show after 3rd successful scan
  const scanCount = context.globalState.get<number>("rakshex.scanCount") ?? 0;
  if (scanCount === 3) {
    const rating = await vscode.window.showQuickPick(
      ["⭐", "⭐⭐", "⭐⭐⭐", "⭐⭐⭐⭐", "⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐"],
      { title: "How is RakshEx working for you?" },
    );
    if (rating) {
      telemetry.track("nps_rating", { stars: rating.length });
      if (rating.length <= 2) {
        const reason = await vscode.window.showInputBox({
          prompt: "What's the biggest issue you're facing?",
        });
        telemetry.track("negative_feedback", { reason });
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Uninstall Survey

```
When user uninstalls the extension:
1. Open browser to "https://rakshex.in/uninstall-survey?user={hash}"
2. Ask: "Why are you leaving?"
   - Didn't find value
   - Too confusing
   - Found bugs
   - Missing features
   - Too expensive
   - Other
3. Ask: "What would make you come back?"
4. Offer: "Email us directly: support@rakshex.in"
```

### Rage Click Detection

```typescript
// Track rapid successive clicks on the same element
let lastClickTarget = "";
let lastClickTime = 0;
let clickCount = 0;

function detectRageClick(target: string) {
  const now = Date.now();
  if (target === lastClickTarget && now - lastClickTime < 1000) {
    clickCount++;
    if (clickCount >= 3) {
      telemetry.track("rage_click", { target });
      // Show: "Having trouble? Get help →"
    }
  } else {
    clickCount = 1;
  }
  lastClickTarget = target;
  lastClickTime = now;
}
```
