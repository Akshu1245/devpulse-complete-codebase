## 2. FEEDBACK TRIAGE SYSTEM

### Labels

| Label         | Meaning                 | Action          |
| ------------- | ----------------------- | --------------- |
| `p0-critical` | Blocks usage            | Fix within 24h  |
| `p1-major`    | Degrades experience     | Fix within 48h  |
| `p2-minor`    | Cosmetic / nice-to-have | Next sprint     |
| `p3-idea`     | Feature request         | Backlog review  |
| `confirmed`   | Reproducible            | Assign engineer |
| `needs-info`  | Can't reproduce         | Request details |
| `wont-fix`    | Out of scope            | Explain + close |

### Triage Workflow

```
New feedback arrives
    ↓
Auto-categorize (bug vs feature vs question)
    ↓
If bug → Attempt reproduction
    ├─ Reproducible → Label confirmed + severity
    └─ Not reproducible → Label needs-info
    ↓
If feature → Check against roadmap
    ├─ Aligns → Label p2-minor or p3-idea
    └─ Doesn't align → Label wont-fix
    ↓
Daily triage meeting (15 min)
    ├─ Assign p0/p1 to engineers
    ├─ Schedule p2 for next sprint
    └─ Archive p3 to backlog
```

## 3. USER PAIN ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK

### Pain Severity Matrix

| Pain                    | Frequency | Impact           | Severity | Action            |
| ----------------------- | --------- | ---------------- | -------- | ----------------- |
| "Can't connect API key" | Daily     | Blocks all usage | CRITICAL | Fix auth flow     |
| "Scan takes too long"   | Weekly    | Degrades UX      | MAJOR    | Optimize workers  |
| "False positive on JWT" | Daily     | Wastes time      | MAJOR    | Improve detection |
| "Want Bruno support"    | Weekly    | Feature gap      | MINOR    | Add to roadmap    |
| "Dark mode please"      | Monthly   | Cosmetic         | MINOR    | Already exists    |

### Analysis Method

1. Collect all feedback with category tags
2. Count frequency per pain point
3. Measure impact (blocks / degrades / cosmetic)
4. Calculate severity = frequency × impact
5. Sort by severity, fix top 5 weekly

## 5. CLOSING THE LOOP

When a user's feedback leads to a fix:

1. **Email them:** "You asked for X — we shipped it!"
2. **In-product toast:** "New: You can now do X"
3. **Changelog credit:** "Thanks to @user for suggesting this"
4. **Beta perks:** Priority access to new features

This creates a feedback flywheel:

```
User reports issue → We fix it → User feels heard → User reports more
```
