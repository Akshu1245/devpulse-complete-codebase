## SCALING ROADMAP

### Phase 1: Current → 1K Users (Now)

- [ ] Single API server
- [ ] Single MySQL instance
- [ ] Single Redis instance
- [ ] Status: ✅ Ready

### Phase 2: 1K → 10K Users (Month 2)

- [ ] API: 3 replicas with load balancer
- [ ] DB: Read replica for analytics queries
- [ ] Redis: Sentinel for HA
- [ ] CDN: CloudFront for static assets
- [ ] Status: \_\_\_

### Phase 3: 10K → 50K Users (Month 4)

- [ ] API: 10+ replicas, auto-scaling
- [ ] DB: Sharding by workspace
- [ ] Redis: Cluster mode
- [ ] Queue: Separate workers per job type
- [ ] WebSocket: Dedicated gateway service
- [ ] Status: \_\_\_

### Phase 4: 50K → 200K Users (Month 8)

- [ ] Multi-region deployment
- [ ] Edge caching for API responses
- [ ] Event sourcing for telemetry
- [ ] Dedicated analytics pipeline
- [ ] Status: \_\_\_

## AUTOSCALING RULES

```yaml
api_server:
  min_replicas: 2
  max_replicas: 20
  scale_up:
    cpu: > 70% for 2 min
    memory: > 80% for 2 min
    requests_per_pod: > 500 for 1 min
  scale_down:
    cpu: < 30% for 5 min

scan_workers:
  min_replicas: 2
  max_replicas: 50
  scale_up:
    queue_depth: > 100 for 1 min
  scale_down:
    queue_depth: < 10 for 5 min

websocket_server:
  min_replicas: 2
  max_replicas: 10
