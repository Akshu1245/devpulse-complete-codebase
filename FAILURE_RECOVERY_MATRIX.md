## RECOVERY PROCEDURES

### MySQL Connection Pool Exhaustion

```bash
# 1. Check current connections
mysql -e "SHOW STATUS LIKE 'Threads_connected';"

# 2. Restart API dynos to clear stale connections
render deploy --restart

# 3. Verify health check returns 200
curl https://api.rakshex.in/api/health

# 4. If still failing, enable emergency read-only mode
# (serves cached data, queues writes)
```

### Redis Complete Outage

```bash
# 1. Confirm Redis is down
redis-cli ping

# 2. Switch to in-memory fallback (automatic)
# Rate limits use Map() instead of Redis

# 3. Provision new Redis instance via Redis Cloud dashboard

# 4. Update REDIS_URL env var
render env set REDIS_URL=<new-url>

# 5. Verify connectivity
redis-cli -u $REDIS_URL ping
```

### OpenAI API Outage

```
# Automatic — handled by circuit breaker
# No manual intervention needed
# System will:
# 1. Open circuit after 5 failures
# 2. Return cached responses where possible
# 3. Retry every 30 seconds (half-open)
# 4. Close circuit when healthy
```

### VS Code Extension Offline

```
# Automatic — handled by extension
# 1. Detect network failure (fetch timeout)
# 2. Cache last known state
# 3. Queue user actions locally
# 4. Show "Offline mode" indicator in status bar
# 5. Auto-sync when network returns
```
