## The Problem

If you're building with AI, you're probably paying **3× more** for LLM APIs than you realize.

- **Hidden reasoning tokens** aren't shown in provider dashboards
- **Rogue agents** can loop infinitely, burning $200+ overnight
- **API keys leak** into shared collections without anyone noticing

## What RakshEx Does

### 1. Hidden Cost Detection 💰

Reveals reasoning tokens that OpenAI, Anthropic, and Gemini hide from you.

- Per-endpoint cost breakdown
- Weekly spend tracking
- Alerts when costs spike unexpectedly

### 2. AgentGuard Kill Switch 🛑

Auto-stops infinite loops and runaway agents in real-time.

- Detects recursive API call patterns
- Blocks cost anomalies
- Configurable thresholds per project

### 3. Instant Security Scan 🔍

Import any Postman, OpenAPI, or Bruno collection. Get a full security report in seconds.

- Secret detection
- Auth weakness detection
- Injection vulnerability scanning
- OWASP API Top 10 coverage

## Setup (30 Seconds)

1. **Install** — Search "RakshEx" in the VS Code Extensions panel
2. **Connect** — Run `RakshEx: Sign in with API Key` (get a free key at [rakshex.in](https://rakshex.in))

- 🔒 **API keys are encrypted** — stored in VS Code's SecretStorage (OS keychain)
- 🔒 **No prompt logging** — we never see your LLM prompts or responses
- 🔒 **Telemetry is optional** — opt out anytime in settings
