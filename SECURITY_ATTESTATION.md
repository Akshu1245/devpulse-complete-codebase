## SECURITY PRINCIPLES

1. **Defense in depth** — Multiple layers of protection
2. **Least privilege** — Access only what's necessary
3. **Zero trust** — Verify everything, trust nothing
4. **Transparency** — Open about our security practices
5. **Continuous improvement** — Security is never "done"
