## POST 1: "The Hidden Cost of LLM Reasoning Tokens"

### Headline

We Analyzed 50 AI Apps. They're Paying 2× More Than They Realize.

### Outline

```
1. Hook: "$3,720 OpenAI bill. But the dashboard only showed $1,240."
2. What are reasoning tokens? (explain simply)
3. The data: 50 apps, 30 days, hidden cost breakdown
4. Why providers hide this (technical + business reasons)
5. How we detect it (patent-pending method)
6. Actionable: How developers can audit their own costs
7. CTA: Try RakshEx free
```

### Key Stats to Include

## POST 2: "How We Built AgentGuard: Stopping Rogue AI Agents in Real-Time"

### Headline

Stopping a $500 Infinite Loop in 4.2 Seconds

### Outline

```
1. Hook: "An agent recursively called itself for 6 hours. Cost: $247."
2. The problem: Why infinite loops are so common in AI apps
3. Architecture: How AgentGuard intercepts API calls
4. Detection algorithm: Pattern matching + anomaly scoring
5. Kill switch: How we stop it without breaking the app
6. Results: 47 incidents blocked in 30 days
7. Technical deep dive (optional section)
8. CTA: Install RakshEx
```

### Code Snippet to Include

```typescript
// Simplified detection logic
if (callRate > 20 && timeWindow < 60) {
  if (isRecursivePattern(callHistory)) {
    killSwitch.activate({
      reason: "infinite_loop_detected",
      costSaved: estimateCost(agent),
    });
  }
}
```
