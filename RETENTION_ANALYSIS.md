## RE-ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY

### At-Risk Users (No activity for 7 days)

**Email:**

```
Subject: Your API collections need a checkup

Hi {{name}},

It's been a week since your last RakshEx scan.

A lot can change in a week — new endpoints, updated dependencies,
new team members pushing code.

Take 30 seconds to rescan:

This week, 12 vulnerabilities were found across all RakshEx users.
Make sure yours aren't among them.
