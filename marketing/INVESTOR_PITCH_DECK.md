# RakshEx Investor Pitch Deck

> 12-slide deck for seed/Series A fundraising. Designed for 3-minute pitch + 10-minute Q&A.

---

## Slide 1 — Title

**RakshEx — AI Runtime Governance Platform**

- Tagline: "Secure Your AI Agents Before They Cost You"
- Founded: Jan 2026 | Bengaluru, India
- Raising: $500K Seed (18-month runway)
- Contact: akshay@rakshex.in | +91-XXXX-XXXXXX

**Logos:** 4 patents filed, Built in India, Y Combinator W26 (aspirational)

---

## Slide 2 — The Problem (60 seconds)

**Every company deploying AI has three invisible risks:**

1. **Security** — Prompt injection, API leaks, shadow endpoints
   - 73% of enterprises have experienced an AI-related security incident (Gartner 2025)
   - Average cost: $4.2M per breach (IBM Cost of Data Breach Report)

2. **Cost** — LLM bills spiraling out of control
   - Unmonitored AI spend up 340% YoY (a16z State of AI 2025)
   - One rogue agent can burn $50K in a weekend

3. **Compliance** — GDPR, DPDP Act, PCI DSS, SOC 2
   - Regulators now require AI governance documentation
   - Fines up to 4% of global revenue (GDPR Art. 83)

**The gap:** Existing tools solve ONE of these. Nobody solves all three.

| Tool        | Security | Cost   | Compliance |
| ----------- | -------- | ------ | ---------- |
| Helicone    | ❌       | ✅     | ❌         |
| Portkey     | ❌       | ✅     | ❌         |
| Lakera      | ✅       | ❌     | ❌         |
| Snyk        | ⚠️       | ❌     | ❌         |
| **RakshEx** | **✅**   | **✅** | **✅**     |

## Slide 3 — The Solution (45 seconds)

**One platform. Every surface covered.**

```
Developer → RakshEx → Secure AI in Production
```

**Core Modules:**

- **Security Scanner** — 87-payload prompt injection library, BOLA/IDOR detection, secret scanning (AWS, OpenAI, Stripe keys)
- **Cost Monitor** — Per-request cost tracking, Holt-Winters forecasting, anomaly detection, kill switch
- **Compliance Engine** — SOC2 evidence builder, PCI DSS mapping, OWASP Top 10 scoring, export to Vanta/Drata

**Key Differentiator:**

- **Thinking Token Attribution** — First-in-world isolation of reasoning tokens (o1/o3/Claude). Patent NHCE/DEV/2026/002.

**Deployment:** 5-minute setup. VS Code extension + GitHub Action. No infrastructure changes.

---

## Slide 4 — Product Demo (45 seconds)

**"Show, don't tell" — 3 key moments:**

1. **Drop a collection** → Auto-detect 47 endpoints → Find 3 secrets + 2 vulnerabilities in 3 seconds
2. **Set a $500 budget cap** → Kill switch trips at $498 → Alert in Slack + block all LLM calls
3. **Export compliance report** → PCI DSS v4.0.1 mapped → Ready for auditor review

_(Reference: See `marketing/ENTERPRISE_DEMO_DECK.md` for full demo flow)_

## Slide 8 — Competitive Landscape (45 seconds)

**We don't compete with observability tools — we complement them.**

| Competitor   | Strength                    | Weakness                       | Our Edge                           |
| ------------ | --------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| **Helicone** | Best-in-class observability | Zero security features         | We add scanning + compliance       |
| **Portkey**  | LLM gateway + routing       | No API security, no compliance | Security + cost in one platform    |
| **Lakera**   | Prompt injection leader     | Only does prompt injection     | We cover API, cost, compliance too |
| **Snyk**     | Code security giant         | Blind to API & AI surfaces     | Purpose-built for AI agents        |
| **Datadog**  | Monitoring empire           | AI governance is afterthought  | Focused, fast, developer-first     |

**Moat:**

1. **Patents** — 4 filed (thinking token attribution, differential cost computation)
2. **Data flywheel** — Every scan improves detection accuracy
3. **Integration density** — VS Code, GitHub, Slack, 6 LLM providers
4. **India advantage** — Lower burn, same quality, 24/7 coverage
