Hi {{name}},

Quick check-in — have you dropped your first API collection into RakshEx yet?

If not, here is a 2-minute walkthrough:

1. Go to https://rakshex.in/dashboard/collections
2. Click "New Collection"
3. Upload your Postman .json or OpenAPI .yaml
4. Click "Scan"
5. See vulnerabilities in 3 seconds

Most users find at least 2 issues they did not know about.

## Email 3 — Day 7: Kill Switch Setup

**Subject:** Protect yourself from a $50K LLM bill

```
Hi {{name}},

One of our early users had a rogue chatbot burn through $12,000 in a weekend.

Their mistake? No budget cap.

RakshEx's kill switch prevents this. Set it up in 30 seconds:

https://rakshex.in/kill-switch

→ Set monthly budget
→ Choose alert channels (Slack/Email)
→ Enable auto-block

You will sleep better.

## Email 4 — Day 10: Team Invite

**Subject:** Your team is missing out

```
Hi {{name}},

Your Pro trial includes 5 team members. Most security issues are found faster with more eyes.

Invite your team:
https://rakshex.in/team

They will get:
• Shared collections
• Role-based access (Admin/Analyst/Viewer)
• Slack alerts for their projects
• Budget visibility per workspace

4 days left in your trial. Make them count.
