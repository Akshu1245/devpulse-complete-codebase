# Product Hunt Launch Kit

## Launch Date Target

TBD — align with a weekday (Tuesday or Wednesday morning PST) for maximum traffic.

## Product Listing

**Name:** DevPulse
**Tagline:** Open-source security + cost monitoring for production AI agents
**Category:** Developer Tools
**Website:** https://devpulse.in
**Maker:** @devpulsehq (Twitter) + individual maker accounts

### Description (260 char max)

Secure your AI agents before they cost you money or leak data. Open-source. Self-hosted. Works with any LLM.

### Full Description

DevPulse is the open-source platform that monitors, secures, and governs production AI agents — all in one place.

**Security**

- Prompt injection detection (50+ payload patterns)
- PII redaction in request/response
- Shadow API discovery
- Credential leak scanning in Postman/OpenAPI collections

**Cost Control**

- Per-request cost attribution across OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Cohere, Mistral, Groq
- Anomaly alerts when spend spikes
- Hard kill switch + budget caps

**Compliance**

- PCI DSS, OWASP, SOC 2 mapped findings
- Immutable audit logs
- Data Processing Agreement included

**Developer Experience**

- VS Code extension with inline warnings
- GitHub Action for PR-level security gates
- Next.js dashboard with real-time telemetry

**Open Source & Self-Hosted**

- Docker Compose in 10 minutes
- Full data sovereignty (Indian data residency supported)
- No vendor lock-in

Shipped by a team of 1 in India with 4 patents pending. Built because we couldn't find a tool that did security + cost + compliance without $50K enterprise contracts.

## Maker Comment (First Comment)

> Hey PH community — built this after watching a client's AI agent leak PII to a third-party LLM because their "observability tool" only logged latency, not content. That incident cost them a compliance audit and 3 weeks of engineering time.
>
> DevPulse is different: it actually scans for prompt injection, shadow APIs, and credential leaks — not just token counts. And it's open-source, so you can self-host on your own infra (Indian data residency, EU, whatever you need).
>
> The kill switch is my favorite feature: set a monthly budget, and if a runaway script tries to blow it, traffic hard-stops. No "alert that gets buried in Slack." Actually stops.
>
> Built by 1 person in Bangalore. 4 patents pending. Would love your feedback — especially if you're already using Helicone, Portkey, or Lakera and feel the security gap.
>
> P.S. — If you upvote, I will personally send you a 5-minute Loom walkthrough of whatever feature you're most curious about. DM me.

## Twitter Thread (7 Tweets)

**Tweet 1 (Hook):**

> I built an open-source security platform for AI agents after watching a client leak PII to an LLM because their "observability tool" only logged latency.
>
> Today it launches on @ProductHunt.
>
> Here's why DevPulse is different 🧵

**Tweet 2 (Problem):**

> Most AI security tools fall into two traps:
>
> 1. They only observe (Helicone, Portkey) — no blocking
> 2. They only block (Lakera) — no cost visibility
>
> DevPulse does both. Security + cost + compliance. One stack.

**Tweet 3 (Security):**

> Prompt injection? 50+ payload patterns detected in real time.
>
> Shadow APIs? Automatic discovery of undocumented endpoints.
>
> Credential leaks? Scan every Postman collection before it hits prod.
>
> PII? Redacted before it reaches any third-party model.

**Tweet 4 (Cost):**

> The kill switch is brutal and beautiful.
>
> Set a monthly LLM budget. One runaway script tries to blow it? Traffic HARD STOPS. Not a Slack alert. Actually stops.
>
> Works across OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Cohere, Mistral, Groq.

**Tweet 5 (Compliance):**

> PCI DSS. OWASP. SOC 2.
>
> Every finding auto-mapped to the control it violates. Auditors love it. Engineers don't have to manually build compliance reports anymore.

**Tweet 6 (Open Source):**

> It's open-source. Self-host in 10 minutes with Docker Compose.
>
> Indian data residency? Check. EU? Check. Air-gapped? Check.
>
> No $50K enterprise contract required.

**Tweet 7 (CTA):**

> Live on @ProductHunt now.
>
> If you ship AI to production, I'd genuinely appreciate your feedback.

## LinkedIn Post

> After 6 months of solo building in Bangalore, I'm launching DevPulse on Product Hunt today.
>
> DevPulse is an open-source platform that secures, monitors, and governs production AI agents. Think: prompt injection detection + cost anomaly alerts + PCI DSS compliance reporting + a kill switch that actually stops traffic — all in one stack.
>
> Why I built it: A client leaked PII to a third-party LLM because their observability tool only logged latency, not content. That incident cost them a compliance audit and 3 weeks of engineering time. Existing tools were either observability-only (Helicone, Portkey) or security-only (Lakera). No one did both.
>
> Key features:
> 🔒 Prompt injection + shadow API + credential leak scanning
> 💰 Per-request cost tracking across 6 LLM providers
> 🛑 Hard kill switch + budget caps
> 📋 Auto-mapped PCI DSS / OWASP / SOC 2 findings
> 🏠 Self-hosted with Docker Compose (10 min setup)
> 🔌 VS Code extension + GitHub Action
>
> 4 patents pending. Built by 1 person. Open source forever.
>
> If your team ships AI to production, I'd love your feedback. Link in comments.
