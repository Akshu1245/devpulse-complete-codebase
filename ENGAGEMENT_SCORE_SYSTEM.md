### Decay

| Inactivity | Score Decay              |
| ---------- | ------------------------ |
| 1 day      | -5%                      |
| 3 days     | -15%                     |
| 7 days     | -40%                     |
| 14 days    | -70%                     |
| 30 days    | -90% (effectively reset) |

### Score Calculation

```
Raw Score = Σ(event_points) for last 30 days
Weighted Score = (Core × 0.5) + (Discovery × 0.2) + (Social × 0.15) + (Growth × 0.15)
Final Score = Weighted Score × Decay Factor
```
